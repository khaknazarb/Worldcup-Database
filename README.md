# Worldcup-Database
Relational Database Practice

This is the practice of the Relational Database exercise.It is about createing a database called "worldcup" and filling it with data. 
The database "worldcup" contains two tables such as "teams" and "games". The "teams" table has only two columns about team's id and team's name.
The "games" table contains the information about the year of the game, round, winner team's name and its opponents and their goals at the game.
The idea of the practice is to create a "worldcup" database as mentioned above and then record the data from other file into it
with the help of script and then query a info from it. The "insert_data.txt" contains the script to insert the data into database, 
while the "queries.txt" file contains the script to query some info from the "worldcup" database.

Thanks for the freecodecamp for the oportunity to learn and practice for free. 

P.S.

This is my first repository and my first README.md file ever written. Sorry if something is wrong.
